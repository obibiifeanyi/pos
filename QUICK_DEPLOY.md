```

## Step 1: âœ… GitHub Repository Ready!
Your code is already pushed to: **https://github.com/obibiifeanyi/pos**

## Step 2: âœ… Code Already Deployed to GitHub!
All your DreamsPOS code has been successfully pushed to the repository.

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Import your repository: `obibiifeanyi/pos`
4. Configure:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (leave as default)
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty (Vercel will auto-detect)
   - **Output Directory**: Leave empty (using default)

**Note**: The configuration has been simplified to work with Vercel's auto-detection since Composer and PHP aren't available during the build phase.

## Step 4: Environment Variables in Vercel
Add these environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

```
APP_NAME=DreamsPOS
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_KEY=base64:a0M17Qv+VsY8zke1z6/7qyDcu7JZwcgAm44XzABvYVk=

DB_DATABASE=/tmp/database.sqlite
CACHE_DRIVER=array
SESSION_DRIVER=array
LOG_CHANNEL=stderr
```

## Step 5: Deploy!
